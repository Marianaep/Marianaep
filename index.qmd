I am a **bilingual social communicator** with a background in journalism, currently transitioning into the field of **water resources**. My professional experience includes working with rural communities in Colombia on community-based water governance initiatives, where I supported environmental communication, public engagement, and education related to water rights, sustainability, and collective water management. Through this work, I developed a strong interest in environmental literacy and in translating complex scientific, technical, and institutional information into accessible knowledge that can meaningfully support communities and society at large.

Motivated by these experiences, I am currently pursuing a **Professional Master’s degree in Environmental Science and Sustainability** with a focus on Water at Colorado State University. Through this training, I am developing technical knowledge in hydrology, water governance, and environmental policy, while maintaining a multidisciplinary perspective that integrates social, legal, and institutional dimensions. My goal is to combine technical water knowledge with communication as a tool to bridge science and society, contributing to more informed, sustainable, and equitable water decision-making.
