    "title": "Texas Groundwater: A Shared Resource with Fragmented Rules",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Groundwater is the quiet backbone of Texas’s water supply. It provides nearly 60 percent of the water used across the state, sustaining agriculture, cities, and industry, especially during droughts. Yet despite this dependence, Texas continues to manage groundwater through a fragmented legal and institutional framework that struggles to keep pace with growing demand and declining aquifers. Major systems such as the Ogallala, Trinity, and Edwards-Trinity show long-term depletion, revealing a disconnect between how groundwater behaves in nature and how it is governed in law.\nIn Texas, groundwater is legally defined as private property, leaving extraction largely to the discretion of landowners. To introduce some level of oversight, the state created Groundwater Conservation Districts (GCDs), local entities tasked with permitting, planning, and setting long-term management goals known as Desired Future Conditions. While this model prioritizes local control, it has produced uneven results. More than one hundred GCDs operate with varying rules, technical capacity, and financial resources, and roughly one-third of the state remains outside the jurisdiction of any district. In these unregulated areas, pumping is largely unmonitored, creating gaps where aquifers receive little formal protection and long-term planning is nearly impossible.\nThe problem is not only institutional fragmentation, but also a legal separation that ignores hydrological reality. Texas law treats surface water as a public resource and groundwater as private, even though the two are physically connected. Excessive pumping lowers aquifer levels, reduces spring flows, and affects rivers, yet these impacts are rarely accounted for in permitting decisions. Without consistent monitoring and reliable data, groundwater management becomes reactive rather than preventive, undermining informed decision-making and conservation efforts.\nOther states offer lessons Texas could adapt without abandoning its emphasis on local governance. California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act introduced mandatory sustainability planning, basin-level coordination, and state oversight to ensure long-term groundwater balance. Colorado, meanwhile, integrates groundwater into its broader water rights system, requiring universal measurement, hydrologic modeling, and formal mechanisms to prevent injury to other users and surface flows. While both models come with costs and institutional demands, they demonstrate the value of clear standards, data-driven management, and recognition of surface water–groundwater connections.\nTexas does not need a constitutional overhaul to improve its groundwater governance. Strengthening Desired Future Conditions with measurable, statewide minimum standards, closing regulatory gaps in unprotected areas, and requiring universal monitoring would provide a stronger foundation for sustainability. Most importantly, formally recognizing the connection between surface water and groundwater would align the law with hydrological science. As aquifer declines and spring losses become more visible, the challenge is no longer whether Texas can afford to improve groundwater management, but whether it can afford not to.\n\n\n\nImage source: Texas Almanac, Aquifers of Texas\n\n\n← Back to Documentary"

    "title": "When Administrative Flexibility Meets the Limits of Water Law: Reflections on Empire Lodge v. Moyer",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Water conflicts in Colorado often reveal more than a simple dispute between neighbors; they expose the fragile balance between administrative flexibility and the rule of law in a system built on priority. Empire Lodge Homeowners’ Association v. Moyer (2001) is one of those cases. What began as a conflict over a homeowners’ association filling recreational ponds quickly turned into a broader question about authority: who gets to decide when out-of-priority water use is acceptable, and for how long? At stake was not just a creek in Water Division 2, but the integrity of Colorado’s prior appropriation system.\nEmpire Lodge was diverting water out of priority when downstream senior right holders, the Moyers, placed repeated calls on Empire Creek to protect their agricultural use. Rather than shutting down the junior diversion, the State Engineer allowed Empire Lodge to continue operating under a series of administrative substitute supply plans while a formal application to the Water Court was pending. The Colorado Supreme Court drew a firm line here. While the State Engineer may issue temporary approvals, the Court made clear that prolonged or repeated administrative permits cannot replace judicial review. Determining whether a diversion causes injury requires technical and hydrologic evidence, and only the Water Court has the authority to make that determination through an approved augmentation plan.\nThe significance of this decision goes beyond the parties involved. By reaffirming the Water Court’s exclusive role, the ruling strengthens the predictability and transparency of Colorado’s water management system and protects senior rights from gradual erosion through administrative shortcuts. At the same time, it highlights a persistent tension: formal Water Court processes can be costly and time-consuming, particularly for smaller users, while limiting the State Engineer’s flexibility in managing real-world pressures. Yet the alternative—allowing administrative practices to quietly reshape priority—would undermine the very foundation of water governance in Colorado. Empire Lodge v. Moyer ultimately reminds us that informed, evidence-based decisions matter, and that in a system defined by scarcity, the institutions that make those decisions matter just as much.\n\n\n\n\n\n← Back to Documentary"

    "text": "I am a bilingual social communicator with a background in journalism, currently transitioning into the field of water resources. My professional experience includes working with rural communities in Colombia on community-based water governance initiatives, where I supported environmental communication, public engagement, and education related to water rights, sustainability, and collective water management. Through this work, I developed a strong interest in environmental literacy and in translating complex scientific, technical, and institutional information into accessible knowledge that can meaningfully support communities and society at large.\nMotivated by these experiences, I am currently pursuing a Professional Master’s degree in Environmental Science and Sustainability with a focus on Water at Colorado State University. Through this training, I am developing technical knowledge in hydrology, water governance, and environmental policy, while maintaining a multidisciplinary perspective that integrates social, legal, and institutional dimensions. My goal is to combine technical water knowledge with communication as a tool to bridge science and society, contributing to more informed, sustainable, and equitable water decision-making."

    "title": "The Amazon Basin: Water, Climate, and the Limits of Cooperation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Amazon River Basin is one of the most important socio-ecological systems on the planet. Covering nearly 40 percent of South America and stretching across eight countries, it plays a critical role in regulating the global climate, sustaining biodiversity, and supporting millions of people who depend directly on its rivers and forests. Beyond its ecological value, the Amazon is also a cultural territory, home to Indigenous and local communities whose lives, identities, and governance systems are deeply tied to water. Protecting the basin, therefore, is not only an environmental challenge—it is a governance challenge with global implications.\nHydrologically, the Amazon is extraordinary. Massive volumes of water circulate through a dense network of rivers, forests, and aquifers, generating rainfall patterns that influence regional and even global climate systems. This natural self-regulation depends on intact forests and healthy water cycles. Yet deforestation, extractive industries, and climate change are steadily weakening these processes. As precipitation patterns shift and extreme events become more frequent, the resilience of the basin increasingly depends on coordinated, basin-wide water governance rather than isolated national actions.\nSince the late 1970s, Amazonian countries have attempted to address this challenge through transboundary cooperation. The Amazon Cooperation Treaty and its implementing body, the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO), were created to promote dialogue, information exchange, and joint initiatives on water, forests, and climate adaptation. With support from international institutions such as UNEP and the Global Environment Facility, these frameworks have helped establish shared hydrological knowledge, technical cooperation, and a common language around integrated water resources management. On paper, the region has a cooperative architecture that recognizes the Amazon as a shared system.\nIn practice, however, cooperation remains uneven. National priorities differ sharply across the basin. Brazil emphasizes hydropower, navigation, and large-scale infrastructure, while Andean countries tend to frame the Amazon through watershed protection and ecosystem management. These contrasting visions complicate decision-making and slow collective action. At the same time, institutional capacity varies widely among countries, and ACTO itself operates with limited funding and authority, constraining its ability to move from coordination to implementation.\nThe gap between institutional agreements and territorial reality is perhaps the most pressing challenge. Many Amazonian regions remain historically marginalized, with limited state presence, unmet basic needs, and weak regulatory enforcement. In this context, illicit economies—such as illegal mining, logging, land grabbing, and drug trafficking—often exert more control over water and land than formal institutions. These parallel power structures directly undermine water governance, ecosystem protection, and climate adaptation efforts, yet they are rarely addressed head-on within cooperation frameworks.\nAnother limitation lies in climate adaptation. While the Amazon Cooperation Treaty acknowledges climate change as a central concern, long-term adaptive capacity remains weak. Data sharing across countries is fragmented, monitoring systems are inconsistent, and there is little agreement on how to operationalize adaptive water management at the basin scale. Without reliable, shared information, policy decisions risk being reactive rather than preventive, undermining the basin’s resilience.\nStrengthening Amazon water governance requires moving beyond formal cooperation toward more grounded and inclusive implementation. This means reinforcing ACTO’s institutional capacity, securing stable funding, and reducing technical asymmetries among countries. It also requires integrating Indigenous and local communities not just as stakeholders, but as active participants in decision-making, recognizing their knowledge and long-standing water management practices. Finally, addressing illicit economies as an environmental governance issue—not only a security problem—is essential to restoring institutional presence and protecting water systems.\n\nUltimately, the Amazon Basin reminds us that transboundary water governance is not only about treaties and institutions, but about aligning science, policy, and territorial realities. In a context of accelerating climate change, the future of the Amazon will depend on whether cooperation can evolve from dialogue to action. Its sustainability is not merely a regional concern—it is a global responsibility that will shape how societies manage shared water systems in an increasingly uncertain world. \n← Back to Documentary"

    "text": "Mesa de interlocución con el Viceministerio de Agua\n\nRed Nacional de Acueductos Comunitarios de Colombia\nThe discussion centers on the creation and role of the Dialogue table between community water organizations and Colombia’s Vice-ministry of Drinking Water and Basic Sanitation, a dialogue space established to strengthen communication between rural communities and the national government. The conversation highlights how this platform emerged from long-standing demands by community-managed aqueducts to be recognized as key actors in water governance, and how it has allowed communities to present their realities, challenges, and proposals directly to policymakers. The participants emphasize the importance of this space for influencing public policy, improving regulatory frameworks, and ensuring that decisions on water and sanitation reflect local knowledge, territorial diversity, and the social value of community water management, particularly in rural areas.\nView →\n\n\n\n\nAcueductos comunitarios vs Crecimiento Urbanístico\n\nRed Nacional de Acueductos Comunitarios de Colombia\nThe Civic Participation Committee in La Loma los Parra, located in Comuna 14 of Medellín, represents one of the many community aqueducts that actively resist urban development in order to ensure the right to water and protect a legacy of community self-management that has endured for more than 90 years. This organization strives to maintain local control over water resources, defending ancestral practices of collective water governance against pressures from expanding urbanization, and preserving a long-standing tradition of community-led stewardship of water.\nView →\n\n\n\n\nMujeres gestoras comunitarias del agua\n\nCorporacion Ecologica y Cultural Penca de Sabila\nDuring 2021, the organization carried out a training process in the northern municipalities of the Aburrá Valley, Copacabana, Girardota, and Barbosa, working with women associated with three community-managed aqueducts: San Andrés de Girardota, María Santificadora de Copacabana, and Platanito de Barbosa. The process focused on community water governance and the role of women in local practices and organizations. While women participate actively and in large numbers in the day-to-day management of water for families and communities, the discussion highlights a persistent gap between their level of involvement and their representation in spaces of power and decision-making. The experience underscores how women’s contributions to the defense of the right to water are often not reflected in leadership roles or in access to the political, cultural, and material benefits generated by these community water organizations.\n\n\n\nView →\n\n\n\nCampo Vivo: diez años de historia\n\nCorporacion Ecologica y Cultural Penca de Sabila\nTen years have passed since the rural association of San Sebastián de Palmitas, Campo Vivo, was formed with the goal of building an organizational and political project to support agroecological transition, the creation of a solidarity-based economic circuit, and collective crop planning. These tools and practices have enabled the organization to sustain itself over time, strengthening community autonomy and long-term territorial resilience.\n\n\n\nView →"
