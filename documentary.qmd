### **Mesa de Interlocución con el Viceministerio de Agua**

##### [Red Nacional de Acueductos Comunitarios de Colombia](https://redacueductoscomunitarios.co/2021/04/23/caminos-en-defensa-de-la-gestion-comunitaria-del-agua/)

The discussion centers on the creation and role of the **Dialogue table between community water organizations and Colombia’s Vice-ministry of Drinking Water and Basic Sanitation**, a dialogue space established to strengthen communication between rural communities and the national government. The conversation highlights how this platform emerged from long-standing demands by community-managed aqueducts to be recognized as key actors in water governance, and how it has allowed communities to present their realities, challenges, and proposals directly to policymakers. The participants emphasize the importance of this space for influencing public policy, improving regulatory frameworks, and ensuring that decisions on water and sanitation reflect local knowledge, territorial diversity, and the social value of community water management, particularly in rural areas.

### **Acueductos comunitarios vs Crecimiento Urbanístico**

##### [Red Nacional de Acueductos Comunitarios de Colombia](https://redacueductoscomunitarios.co/2020/10/15/gestion-comunitaria-del-agua-mujeres-organizadas-en-su-defensa/)

The Civic Participation Committee in La Loma los Parra, located in Comuna 14 of Medellín, represents one of the many community aqueducts that actively resist urban development in order to ensure the right to water and protect a legacy of community self-management that has endured for more than 90 years. This organization strives to maintain local control over water resources, defending ancestral practices of collective water governance against pressures from expanding urbanization, and preserving a long-standing tradition of community-led stewardship of water.

### **Mujeres gestoras comunitarias del agua**

##### [Corporacion Ecologica y Cultural Penca de Sabila](https://corpenca.org/2021/mujeres-gestoras-comunitarias-del-agua/)

During 2021, the organization carried out a training process in the northern municipalities of the Aburrá Valley, Copacabana, Girardota, and Barbosa, working with women associated with three community-managed aqueducts: San Andrés de Girardota, María Santificadora de Copacabana, and Platanito de Barbosa. The process focused on community water governance and the role of women in local practices and organizations. While women participate actively and in large numbers in the day-to-day management of water for families and communities, the discussion highlights a persistent gap between their level of involvement and their representation in spaces of power and decision-making. The experience underscores how women’s contributions to the defense of the right to water are often not reflected in leadership roles or in access to the political, cultural, and material benefits generated by these community water organizations.

### **Campo Vivo: diez años de historia**

##### Corporacion Ecologica y Cultural Penca de Sabila

Ten years have passed since the rural association of San Sebastián de Palmitas, Campo Vivo, was formed with the goal of building an organizational and political project to support agroecological transition, the creation of a solidarity-based economic circuit, and collective crop planning. These tools and practices have enabled the organization to sustain itself over time, strengthening community autonomy and long-term territorial resilience.
